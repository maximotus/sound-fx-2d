## About

A simple attempt of 2D audio visualization with python. An image gets dynamically resized i a loop depending on the audio input of the microphone.

## Environment

- Python 3.6 (because this is the [last version with a prebuilt wheel of PyAudio](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52283840/i-cant-install-pyaudio-on-windows-how-to-solve-error-microsoft-visual-c-14/52284344#52284344))
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) (depends on Visual C++ 14.0 on Windows which can be downloaded via the [Visual Studio Installer](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022))
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)

## Usage
`python main.py`
Easy as pi(thon)!
